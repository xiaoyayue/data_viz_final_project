# An Exploratory Study of Economic Complexity and Human Development Indicators

## Summary
This project aims to conduct an exploratory data visualization on the correlation betweewn Economic Complexity and Human Development Indicators. Based on the following data visualization, Economic Complexity has predictive power on country's policy orientation and decision-making in the field of human development, and serves as a powerful tool to validate the efficiency of policy changes based on comparative trends. In addition to traditional human development indicators - life expectancy, education, and income, it would be interesting to see whether the rising study of environment and energy can make itself a new human development indicator. The result shows that energy use and CO2 emission can be seen as a measure to represents achievements based on its correlation with Economic Complexity Index, but further study has to be done on the field of renewable energy to draw a more definitive conclusion. 

## Key Term Explaination

### Economic Complexity Index

The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) is a measure of the relative knowledge intensity of an economy. ECI measures the knowledge intensity of an economy by considering the knowledge intensity of the products it exports. ECI has been validated as a relevant economic measure by showing its ability to predict future economic growth and explain international variations in income inequality. Economic Complexity (EC) surpasses the predictive power of economic growth (EG), commonly considered as the unique way to achieve economic and human development.

### Human Development Indicators

Human Development Indicators represents achievements in key dimensions in one's life: live a long and healthy life (life expectancy), be knowledgeable (education), and have a decent standard of living(income per capita). It was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The corresponding Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement. It can also be used to evaluate national policy choices and set policy priorities: how two countries with the same level of income per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. However, the HDI also has limitations by simplifying and capturing only part of what human development entails but not revealing other criteria such as human security.

## Data Sources Description

In this visualization project, 4 datasets are used to create ggplot2, plotly, and tableau visualizations.

- total.csv (represented by object name df in rmarkdown to produce plotly visualizations)

The total datasets stores information on country's ECI and humand development indicators related variables in 2007. Main variables includeds are country name, continent, GDP per capita, ECI, population, life expectancy, lower secondary education completion ratio, primary education duration. The datasets is the results of merging multiple gapminder datasets in RStudio by combining country names and specificy year 2007. 

- total5.csv (represented by object name total5 in rmarkdown to produce ggplot2 visualizations)

The total5 datasets stores information largely similar to total but is instead a timeseries data. In the following ggplot2 visualizations, this dataset is also the results of merging multiple gaminder datasets in RStudio and is used to show the general trend of life expectancy and compared the matchability to that of economic growth and ECI. 

- continent_avg.csv (represented by object name continent_avg in rmarkdown for plotly visualizations)

continent_avg dataset stores timeseries information on each continent's average ECI and lower secondary education completion ratio. This dataset is transformation based on the total5 timeseries data by grouping countries based on continent and calculating the mean value. This dataset is used to create the interactive visualization with year slidebar.

- energy_use and co2_emissions_1964

These two datasets are used to produce the tableau visualization to compare the difference between the average energy use and CO2 emissions per person to evaluate a country's energy use efficiency and possible renewable energy development (with the reference to the average ECI index). The two datasets are transposed before use so that year can be a column variable. The datasets are obtained from the gapminder database. 

- global_power_plant_database

The global_power_plant_databased is used to produce the world map visualization of power plants number, location, and primary fuel type in each country. The dataset is obtained from the World Resource Institute. 

## Technologies and Platforms

### Plotly

Plotly is a technical computing company located in Montreal, Quebec that develops and maintains multiple open-source online data analytics and tutorial tools. Plotly develops easily customizable and declarative packages that seperate execution and specification and thus allow users to focus on more important relationships within the data. Plotlyâ€™s high customizability and dynamicity render it a popular web-based data visualization tool and a R-based data visualization package, though it has comparatively fewer features than Tableau. The following visualizations are produced with plotly package in RStudio and modified by ChartStudio, plotly's online tool for for creating, styling, and publishing interactive web-based charts

## Stories 

### - The Predictive Power of Economic Complexity 
Economic Complexity (EC) surpasses the predictive power of economic growth (EG), commonly considered as the unique way to achieve economic and human development. In the example below, life expectancy is picked as the representative human development indicator since it also reflects the magnitude of other human develoment indicators to some degrees: better educations and better income are key to remain a healthy lifestyle and afford proper care and treatment. The ggplot2 visualizations below substantiate the superiority of EC in evaluating country economic development and performance: the correlation between ECI and life expectancy and ECI is much more clear than that between EG and life expectancy.

### - Economic Complexity's Influence and Validation on Policy Analysis and Priority

As indicated above, Human Development Index can direct government to prioritize key policies areas in a broad policy area with a variety of measures such as education. By dragging the 3D graph below, we can see that lower secondary education completion ratio (ratio) is a much more important and relevant measure than primary education duration (duration). 

#### Educations Parameters and ECI

To investigate further the relationship between EC and secondary education completion ratio the across a time span, we validate their correlation by visualizing their similarities and difference. As seen in the timeseries visualization, we can see that for the variations in ECI corresponds to the variations in completion ratio, especially for the European continent where a majority of countries are highly developed countries and the line and scatters are highly overlapping. For other continents, we can still see that ECI is a pretty good indicator of the indicative trend of lower secondary education duration, despite the comparative magnitude gap between the two.

### ECI and Environment

Since the HDI also has limitations by only capturing part of what human development entails, it is worth thinking whether other parameters can come into the picture that are inclusive, informative, and indicative of country development. As the issue of climate change has been drawing more attentions worldwide, it is time to unfold the impacts of environment and energy on development. Environment is a multi-facet yet tricky factor: it entails promising industrial progress beneficial to product and economic intensity, renewable energy usage indicative to technological advancement, and CO2 emissions alarming to both human health and natural resources development. In the following visualization, we shall explore all questions in mind.

This tableau visualization position the difference between energy use and CO2 emission and the average ECI for each selected country side by side. We can see that it is generally intuitive that a higher average CO2 emission and energy use indicate a higher ECI. However, based on this visualization only, it is hard for us to understand the meanings of energy use divided by CO2 emission in percentage since there is no apparent pattern shown in the visualization.

With the help of the power plant visualization ablove, however, we can find that countries or regions that have high percentage usually have more power plants whose primary fuel type are renewable energies. For example, these two indications co-occure in many Northern European countires, South American countries, and Southeastern countries. Although we cannot have any definitive conclusion, it directs policy makers to an areas worth studying in the future.
